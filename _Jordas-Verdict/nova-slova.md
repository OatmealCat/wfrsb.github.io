# Jordas Verdict - Slowinv Nova

![Nova](https://i.imgur.com/pnfxSi2.png)

Nova is a widely used frame in JV since both itâ€™s variants, speed nova and slow nova, are really helfpul in different stages of the raid.

*_budget build means no forma, no primed warframe, no primed mods, no event or Baro Kit'eer mods, and no mods over rank 8_

## Role: CC

## Build notes

* 145% or higher strength is required to take full advantage of Molecular Prime's slow.
* Duration is also very important because it affects the width of the area covered by Molecular Prime.
* Be sure to equip Flow or Primed Flow to aid you in bomb carrying.
* In the ideal build, Rush can be swapped for Natural Talent to decrease Molecular Prime's casting speed, or for Constitution to make each cast a wider area.
* In the budget build, Escape Velocity can be swapped for Mobilize and the rank of Narrow Minded increased to 8 if you prefer the higher parkour speed or don't plan on using Worm Holes as much.

## Tactics

* Your main job is to CC the enemies in stage 3, making it easier for unexperienced people to focus on the objective and not struggling to stay alive.
* DO NOT slow down the enemies in either stage 1 or 2. In both stages, slowing down the enemies will result in having  a harder time in getting injector charges, making the raid progress a lot slower.
