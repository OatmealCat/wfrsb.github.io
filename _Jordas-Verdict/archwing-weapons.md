## Build notes

* Build for as much damage as possible.
* If you do not own Shell Rush, put the last elemental mod in its slot. Make sure you're dealing radiation, magnetic and viral damage in that case.

## Fluctus

The Fluctus may not deal as much damage as the Velocitus and Imperator (Vandal) it provides great utility due to the infinite punch through it comes with.
