# Law of Retribution - Banshee

Banshee might not be the best choice for CC in Raids. However, her high energy pool and unique abilities make her a very useful frame in specific stages of the raid.

## Role: Bomb Carrier, Damage Amp

## Build notes

* There can be a lot of versatility with Banshee builds for LoR
* The build needs to fulfill core requirements of 100+% power strength, cast speed, and high power pool
* The mods that are needed are as listed
* Natural Talent
* Quick Thinking
* Primed Flow (or regular if you don't have primed)
* Intensify/Blind Rage/Transient Fortitude (choose 1 or 2 based of the other 5 mods you choose.)
* Aura Mod (Preferably Corrosive Projection or Enemy Radar)
* For the other 5 mods you can choose based on how you like to play.
* Make sure Sonar lasts at least 5 seconds and has at least 15m range.
* Keep the core requirements in mind when making your build if you choose to make your own

## Tactics

* Soundquake is great hard CC, however you can easily kill enemies with this (especially if you are using RQ).
* Use this skill ONLY in emergencies on the hijack part of LoR.
* Your main job comes at the very end of the raid as your team is destroying the last tower.
* During this part, position yourself within sonar range of Vay Hek and spam sonar.
* Sonar only applies after Vay Hek becomes vulnerable
* If your team is shooting the bomb to destroy towers, spam sonar when the bomb is 70%-80% charge
* If your team lets the bomb decay to destroy towers, spam sonar when the bomb has around 40%-50% of its charge left.
* Sonar stacks multiplicatively.
* Vay Hek should die as he touches the ground if you did everything right.

## Side-Notes 

* Due to the fact that Banshee really only needs 5 mods to be raid ready, I recommend getting her if you don't have an extensive mod collection.
