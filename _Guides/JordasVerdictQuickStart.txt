# Jordas Verdict Quickstart guide

JV can be a very frustrating and confusing experience at first, especially if you are trying to learn it by yourself. Here are some pointers to make it as easy as possible to start earning that Arcane Energize set!

* * *

1.	Bring a good archwing shown below in order of viability:
	- Amesha (the best by far for beginners, even a rank 0 Amesha is better than any other archwing)
	- Odonata
	- Elytron and Itzal
1.	Build your Antiserum Injector
	- If you don't have enough fragments to build one yet, try asking for an 'antiserum fragment farm' in recruiting chats of Warchat or RSB, linked below
	- It is possible to do the raid without an injector equipped, however you will be prone do dying and will be unable to interact with certain mechanics.
	- If you decide to do Jordas without an injector, make sure you pick up enough fragments to build one on your first run or by running Infested Salvage!
1.	Craft shield restore pads
	- These are highly useful in phase 3 of the raid.
	- If you have the Amesha archwing, you probably don't need any shield restores.
	- Even smaller sizes will do if you don't have access to the large ones
	- Bind your shield restores to a keyboard button, you might have to use them quickly.
1.	Join a Jordas Verdict bus on RSB.
	- Join the server.
	- Add the LFBus Role and begin looking for a bus.

## Antiserum Fragment Farming

You can farm antiserum fragments in the the Jordas Verdict or in Infested Salvage.

Listed below is the amount of fragments required to research the antiserum injector in a Clan Dojo's Energy Lab.
In addition to the amount in the table you will require an additional 500 fragments to build a injector for yourself. 

| Clan Size    | Fragments Required |
|:-------------|:-------------------|
| Ghost        |  600               |
| Shadow       |  1,800             |
| Storm        |  6,000             |
| Mountain     |  18,0000           |
| Moon         |  60,0000           |
